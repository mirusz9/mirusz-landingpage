								Hi, my name is Adam Sztano, a.k.a. <span className="monospace">mirusz9</span>.

							<p>
								I study Computer Science and Engineering at{' '}
								<a href="https://tudelft.nl" target="_blank">

								<h2>Skills Management Tool</h2>
								<span className="date"># 06/2025</span>
							</div>
							<p>
								Developed for the Dutch Ministry of Defence, this project is a comprehensive skill
								management system built with Next.js 15 and Express.js, designed to track and develop
								employee competencies across the organization. The application features hierarchical
								skill tree management, interactive spider web charts for skill visualization, and
								role-based access control with LDAP integration.
							</p>
							<a className="image">
								<img src={smtImg} alt="Skills Management Tool" loading="lazy" />
							</a>
							<p>
								The system includes advanced features such as real-time data visualization using D3.js,
								comprehensive testing with 100% code coverage, and a modular component architecture with
								Storybook documentation. Key functionalities include team management capabilities,
								feedback systems for manager-employee communication, advanced search functionality, and
								responsive design with full accessibility support including keyboard navigation
								throughout the interface.

							<p>
								Understanding the IB and AP systems was a real challenge for me as our family had no
								previous experience with these programs. We had to figure out all the requirements from
								a 100-page document. As this process was overwhelming for many students, I came up with
								the idea to create a schedule planner for my school. This website aimed to explain how
								the AP, IB, and credit systems work, what classes one needs to graduate, and the
								prerequisites for any given course.

								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs" target="_blank">
									3Blue1Brown's video

								on YouTube. It is based on an SIR model that can be customized with many settings such
								as the rate of spread of the virus, the percentage of the population following social
								distancing rules, or the duration for which a cell is infectious.

								If you'd like to try the simulation out, the installation and the settings are

							<p>
								I attempted to create a 2D sidescroller game, similar to Terraria <i>from scratch</i>. I
								was really drawn to the idea of creating my own procedural world generation code, as
								I've always wondered how games like Minecraft and Terraria generate their huge and
								diverse environments.
							</p>
							<p>
								The map generator procedurally creates one large interconnected cave that tries to be as
								realistic as possible. Everything was made from scratch: the textures, the physics and
								collision system, the rendering engine and the map generation.
